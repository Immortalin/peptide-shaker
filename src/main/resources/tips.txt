Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are color coded in <b>PeptideShaker</b>.<br><br>You can change the colors via <i>Search Parameters</i> on the <i>Edit</i> menu.<br><br>You can also verify the location of the PTMs in the <i>Modifications</i> tab!
Not getting the result you wanted?<br><br>When creating a new project, be sure that the <i>Search Parameters</i> and <i>Import Filters</i> are correct!
How to run user-friendly OMSSA and X!Tandem searches?<br><br>Try <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>!
How did you generate your mgf file?<br><br>Processing of the raw data can have dramatic impact on the final result.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net">ProteoWizard</a>.
Need more help?<br><br>Look for the question marks.<br><br>We will also be happy to answer your questions on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Which database are you using?<br><br>Large databases increases the amount of false positive identifications. Use only the species expected in the sample.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</a>.
<i>PeptideShaker</i> not finding your protein?<br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that its parsing is done correctly!
Did you expect more peptides/proteins?<br><br>Verify the search engine performance(s) in the <i>Spectrum IDs</i> tab. Adjust the validation settings in the <i>Validation</i> tab.<br><br><i>If comparing results with other packages, remember to use the same search, import and validation settings!</i>
Using Mascot?<br><br>Make sure that the database used is identical to the one provided to <i>PeptideShaker</i> and that the Mascot <i>decoy</i> option is <b><u>not</u></b> selected!
Did you check the QC plots?<br><br>Quality Control plots are available in the <i>QC Plots</i> tab. That way you can verify that everything went OK during the identification process.
Need another QC metric/plot?<br><br>Propose it on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!
Too many/too few peak annotations?<br><br>Change the minimum peak intensity threshold by scrolling the mouse wheel.<br>Or change the m/z accuracy by holding the control key while scrolling.<br><br>Controllers are available in the <i>View</i> menu under <i>Spectrum Sliders</i>.
Many unidentified spectra?<br><br>Export the unidentified spectra via <i>Follow Up Analysis</i> on the <i>Export</i> menu.
Create inclusion lists?<br><br>Inclusion lists can be automatically generated using the <i>Follow-up Analysis</i> dialog accessible from the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us using our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Share PeptideShaker projects?<br><br>Export the project and related files as a zip file in the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>To open on another computer simply unzip the file and open the cps file in <i>PeptideShaker</i>!
Export results to Excel?<br><br>Export the entire project or specific identification features via <i>Identification Features</i> in the <i>Export</i> menu. The files can be directly opened into Excel!
Never run different instances of PeptideShaker from the same .jar file!
Investigate a specific Protein/Peptide/PSM?<br><br>See how to customize star/hide filters via <i>Filters</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu.
Looking for a specific protein or peptide?<br><br>Use the <i>Find</i> box in the upper right corner!
To get the highest number of reliable hits, <i>PeptideShaker</i> separates PSMs according to search engine charge and peptides according to modification status. See the <i>Validation</i> tab. Note that separation will only be conducted when statistical significance is ensured!
Not all PTMs are supported by X!Tandem, e.g., terminal modification at specific amino acids. We advise to search allowing modified termini or amino-acids. The irrelevantly modified peptides can subsequently be dismissed using the <i>Exclude Unknown PTMs</i> in the <i>Import Filters</i> when loading the files.
<i>Coverage 65% of max 50%</i>?<br><br>Answer: The estimation of the maximum coverage does not account for missed cleavages or semi-tryptic peptides!
How much memory is allocated to <b>PeptideShaker</b>? For fast processing allocate as much memory as possible to <b>PeptideShaker</b>. This setting can be optimized in <i>Java Option</i> available in the <i>Edit</i> menu.

Database import is slow? The first time you work with a database PeptideShaker needs to index all the possible peptides. This task is time consuming, but will be done only once for each database.
