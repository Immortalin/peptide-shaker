            This dialog makes it straightforward to export data from <b>PeptideShaker</b> to tab separated text files 
            at five levels: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Proteins</li>
            <li>Peptides</li>
            <li>PSMs</li>
            <li>Search Engines</li>
            <li>Complete Project</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
            For the first four you can decide with features you want to export. 
            <br><br>
            Note that you can only export 
            features for one level at the time, i.e., proteins <b>or</b> peptides, not proteins <b>and</b> peptides. However, 
            some of the export options includes information from other levels.
            <br><br>
            The export Project option is an advanced export and recommended for expert use only. In most cases 
            you should be able to obtain the wanted export via the other export options.

            <i>Note that you can also export the content of most tables and all plots via the contextual export options 
                available in the upper right corner of each table/plot.</i>
