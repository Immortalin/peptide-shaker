        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The spectrum identification panel details how peptides were matched to spectra for the various search engines.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Search Engine Performance</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The search engine performance table displays how many spectra would be matched at 1% FDR using the search engines 
            separately. The same information is also shown in the corresponding Venn diagram.
        </p>

        <h3>Peptide-Spectrum Matches</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            For each spectrum it is possible to see all peptide assumptions made by the various search engines with the corresponding 
            score and confidence. On top of these the PSM retained by <b>PeptideShaker</b> is displayed. Note that selecting the PSM 
            of choice updates the spectrum annotation.
