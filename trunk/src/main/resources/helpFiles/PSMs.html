        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The spectrum identification panel shows how peptides are matched to spectra using the various search engines.

        </p>

        <h3>Search Engine Performance</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The search engine performance table displays how many spectra would be matched at 1% FDR using the search engines separately along with the corresponding Venn diagram.

        <h3>Peptide-Spectrum Matches</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            For each spectrum it is possible to see all peptide assumptions made by the various search engines with the corresponding score and confidence. On top of these is displayed the PSM retained by <b>PeptideShaker</b>. Note that selecting the PSM of choice updates the display.
