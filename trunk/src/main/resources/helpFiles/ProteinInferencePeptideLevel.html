        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            PeptideShaker dramatically simplifies the protein inference problem, i.e. the presence of shared peptides between protein sequences. It is here however possible to inspect the protein inference status of a specific peptide.
            <br><br>
            Peptides are color coded depending on whether they can be mapped to a unique protein, a group of isoforms, a group of isoforms and unrelated proteins or totally unrelated proteins. Note that this classification of proteins is roughly made by PeptideShaker using the protein description. The upper left button allows you to change the protein inference status of the selected peptide.

        <h3>Retained and other proteins</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The retained proteins is the list of proteins where this peptide can be mapped to and which were actually retained by PeptideShaker. To inspect these proteins, you can type the protein accession on the top right search field of PeptideShaker when on the Overview tab.
            <br><br>
            It can however be that a peptide can be mapped to a protein which was not retained by PeptideShaker. These secondary accessions are displayed in the 'Other Proteins' table.
