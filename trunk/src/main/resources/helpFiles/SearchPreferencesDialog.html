        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In order to adapt the process to the search it is necessary to little information about it to <b>PeptideShaker</b>. Some are set by default, some need to be set manually. If the identification files were generated using <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com"><b>SearchGUI</b></a>, settings will be loaded automatically!

        <h3>Search Parameters</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The search parameters are mandatory for the import of identifications as well as for their processing and their display. Set here the enzyme used, the number of allowed missed cleavages and the fragment ion mass tolerance.

        <h3>Modification Profile</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The modification profile is a project-dependant set of expected modifications. <b>PeptideShaker</b> will look in this list when a PTM is found in the identification result. Modifications can be grouped into families and will then be processed together. It is vital that two different families do not contain PTMs of the same mass!
            <br>
            <br>
            The modification profile can be saved and opened from here as well.
