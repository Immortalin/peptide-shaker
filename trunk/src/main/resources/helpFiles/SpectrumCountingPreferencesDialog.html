        <ul>
            <li> 
                <b>emPAI:</b> The exponentially modified protein abundance index is based on the number of validated peptides 
                with respect to the theoretic number of peptides for a given protein. See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958392">Ishihama et al</a> for more details.
            </li> 
            <li> 
                <b>NSAF:</b> The normalized spectrum abundance factor is based on the number of validated spectra normalized by 
                the protein size. See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17138671">Paoletti et al</a> for more details.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Switching between the two is done in this dialog. 
            Here you can also decide if only validated hits are to be included in the methods.
