You can contribute to PeptideShaker! <br><br> Use our <a href=mailto:peptide-shaker@googlegroups.com>mailing list</a> to explain us your special needs and exchange new ideas!
Looking for a specific protein?<br><br>You can search/filter proteins using the menu "Filter" in the overview tab.
Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are color coded in peptide sequences.<br><br> You can change the color of every PTM in Edit -> Search parameters.<br><br>You can also verify the location of the PTM in the modification tab!
User-defined modifications: <br><br> If you have user-defined modifications you should implement them in the conf/peptideshaker_usermods.xml file similarly as in <a href="searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>. <br><br>Before loading your files don't forget to add your modification in the search parameters!
When creating a new project, be sure that the search parameters and import filters are correct!
How to run user-friendly OMSSA and X!Tandem searches? We recommend the use of <a href="searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>!
In order to get the best perfomance, give PeptideShaker as much memory as possible in the JavaOptions.txt file located in the conf folder. More information available in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section of our website.
Do all your spectrum titles have different titles? <br><br>PeptideShaker cannot differentiate spectra with equal names in the same mgf file.
How did you generate your mgf file? <br><br>Processing of the raw data can have dramatic impact on the final result, we recommend the use of <a href="openms.de">OpenMS</a> for the spectrum processing.
Need more help? <br><br> Question marks are here to guide you to the help and we will be happy to answer your questions on our <a href=mailto:peptide-shaker@googlegroups.com>mailing list</a>.
Which database are you using? <br><br>Large databases will increase the amount of false positive identifications. For best results you should use only the species expected in the sample. We recommend the use of <a href="uniprot.org">UniProtKB</a> databases.
Peptide-Shaker does not find your protein? <br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that its parsing is done correctly!
