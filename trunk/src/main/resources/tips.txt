You can contribute to <i>PeptideShaker</i>!<br><br> Use our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a> to explain your special needs and exchange new ideas!
Looking for a specific protein?<br><br>You can search/filter proteins via the <i>Filter</i> menu in the <i>Overview</i> tab.<br><br>You can also star proteins of interest or hide contaminants in the <i>Overview</i> tab.
Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are color coded in peptide sequences.<br><br>You can change the colors via <i>Search Parameters</i> on the <i>Edit</i> menu.<br><br>You can also verify the location of the PTMs in the <i>Modifications</i> tab!
User-defined modifications can be implemented in the conf/peptideshaker_usermods.xml file similarly as in <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>.<br><br>Before loading your files don't forget to add your modifications in the <i>Search Parameters</i>!
Not getting the result you wanted?<br><br>When creating a new project, be sure that the <i>Search Parameters</i> and <i>Import Filters</i> are correct!
How to run user-friendly OMSSA and X!Tandem searches?<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>!
In order to get the best perfomance, give <i>PeptideShaker</i> as much memory as possible in the <i>JavaOptions.txt</i> file located in the <i>conf</i> folder.<br><br>More information available in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section of our website.
Do all your spectra have different titles?<br><br><i>PeptideShaker</i> is not able to differentiate spectra with identical titles in the same mgf file.
How did you generate your mgf file?<br><br>Processing of the raw data can have dramatic impact on the final result.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://open-ms.sourceforge.net">OpenMS</a> for the spectrum processing.
Need more help?<br><br>Look for the question marks.<br><br>We will also be happy to answer your questions on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Which database are you using?<br><br>Large databases will increase the amount of false positive identifications. For best results you should use only the species expected in the sample.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</a> databases.
<i>PeptideShaker</i> not finding your protein?<br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that its parsing is done correctly!
Did you expect more peptides/proteins?<br><br>In the <i>Spectrum IDs</i> tab you can verify the performance of all search engines. You can also adjust validation settings in the <i>Validation</i> tab.<br><br><i>If you compare the results with other packages, remember that you should use same search, import and validation settings!</i>
Using Mascot Results?<br><br>Make sure that the database used for the search is the same as the one provided to <i>PeptideShaker</i> and that the <i>decoy</i> option is <b><u>not</u></b> selected!
Did you check the QC plots?<br><br>Quality Control plots are available in the <i>QC</i> tab. You can verify that everything went OK during the identification process.
Need another QC metric/plot?<br><br>Propose it on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!
Too many/too few peak annotations?<br><br>You can change the minimum peak intensity considered by simply scrolling the mouse wheel.<br>You can also increase and decrease the m/z tolerance set in the <i>Search Parameters</i> by holding the control key while scrolling.<br><br>Controllers are available in the <i>View</i> menu under <i>Spectrum Sliders</i>.
Many unidentified spectra?<br><br>You can export the spectra which do not present a validated identification using the <i>Follow-up Analysis</i> tool accessible from the <i>Export</i> menu.
How to create an inclusion list?<br><br>Inclusion lists can be automatically generated using the <i>Follow-up Analysis</i> tool accessible from the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>If your instrument is not available or if you need other options don't hesitate to contact us using our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
How to share PeptideShaker projects?<br><br>Export the project with all related files in a zip folder via <i>PeptideShaker Project</i> in the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>To open the project on another computer simply unzip the file and open the cps file in PeptideShaker!
How to export results to Excel?<br><br>Export the entire project or identification features via the <i>Identification Features</i> export tool available in the <i>Export</i> menu. The tab separated file can be directly opened, imported or copy-pasted into Excel!
