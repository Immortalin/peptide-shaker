You can contribute to <i>PeptideShaker</i>!<br><br> Use our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a> to explain your special needs and exchange new ideas!
Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are color coded in peptide sequences.<br><br>You can change the colors via <i>Search Parameters</i> on the <i>Edit</i> menu.<br><br>You can also verify the location of the PTMs in the <i>Modifications</i> tab!
User-defined modifications can be implemented in the conf/peptideshaker_usermods.xml file similarly as in <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>.<br><br>Before loading your files don't forget to add your modifications in the <i>Search Parameters</i>!
Not getting the result you wanted?<br><br>When creating a new project, be sure that the <i>Search Parameters</i> and <i>Import Filters</i> are correct!
How to run user-friendly OMSSA and X!Tandem searches?<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>!
In order to get the best perfomance, give <i>PeptideShaker</i> as much memory as possible in the <i>JavaOptions.txt</i> file located in the <i>conf</i> folder.<br><br>More information available in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section of our website.
Do all your spectra have different titles?<br><br><i>PeptideShaker</i> is not able to differentiate spectra with identical titles in the same mgf file.
How did you generate your mgf file?<br><br>Processing of the raw data can have dramatic impact on the final result.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://open-ms.sourceforge.net">OpenMS</a> for the spectrum processing.
Need more help?<br><br>Look for the question marks.<br><br>We will also be happy to answer your questions on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Which database are you using?<br><br>Large databases will increase the amount of false positive identifications. For best results you should use only the species expected in the sample.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</a> databases.
<i>PeptideShaker</i> not finding your protein?<br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that its parsing is done correctly!
Did you expect more peptides/proteins?<br><br>In the <i>Spectrum IDs</i> tab you can verify the performance of all search engines. You can also adjust validation settings in the <i>Validation</i> tab.<br><br><i>If you compare the results with other packages, remember that you should use same search, import and validation settings!</i>
Using Mascot Results?<br><br>Make sure that the database used for the search is the same as the one provided to <i>PeptideShaker</i> and that the <i>decoy</i> option is <b><u>not</u></b> selected!
Did you check the QC plots?<br><br>Quality Control plots are available in the <i>QC Plots</i> tab. You can verify that everything went OK during the identification process.
Need another QC metric/plot?<br><br>Propose it on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!
Too many/too few peak annotations?<br><br>Change the minimum peak intensity considered by scrolling the mouse wheel.<br>Or increase/decrease the m/z tolerance by holding the control key while scrolling.<br><br>Controllers are available in the <i>View</i> menu under <i>Spectrum Sliders</i>.
Many unidentified spectra?<br><br>You can export the spectra which do not present a validated identification using the <i>Follow-up Analysis</i> tool accessible from the <i>Export</i> menu.
Create inclusion lists?<br><br>Inclusion lists can be automatically generated using the <i>Follow-up Analysis</i> tool accessible from the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us using our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Share PeptideShaker projects?<br><br>Export the project with all related files as a zip folder via <i>PeptideShaker Project</i> in the <i>Export</i> menu.<br><br>To open the project on another computer simply unzip the file and open the cps file in <i>PeptideShaker</i>!
Export results to Excel?<br><br>Export the entire project or identification features via the <i>Identification Features</i> option in the <i>Export</i> menu. The tab separated file can be directly opened, imported or copy-pasted into Excel!
Never run different instances of PeptideShaker from the same .jar file!
Want to investigate specific Protein/Peptide/PSM?<br><br>In every table you can star Protein/Peptide/PSM. By default proteins from your protease are marked <i>hidden</i>.<br><br>See how to customize star/hide filters using <i>Star/Hide Filters</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu.
In order to get the highest amount of reliable hits, <i>PeptideShaker</i> separates PSMs according to the charge found by the search engine and peptides according to the modification status. The result of this grouping is visible in the <i>Validation</i> tab. Note that separation will only be conducted when statistical significance is ensured!
Some modifications are not supported by X!Tandem like terminal modification at specific amino acids. We advise to search allowing modified termini or amino-acids. The irrelevantly modified peptides can subsequently be dismissed using the "remove unknown PTMs" in the "import filters" when loading the files.
Did you check the enzyme configuration?<br><br>Enzymes are configured in the <i>peptideshaker_enzymes.xml</i> file located in the <i>conf</i> folder. Ensure that the cleavage site is set properly to have accurate coverage and spectrum counting estimations.
<i>coverage 65% of max 50%</i>, how is that possible?<br><br>The estimation of the maximal coverage does not account for missed cleavages or semi-tryptic peptides!
How much memory is allocated to PeptideShaker? For the fastest processing allocate as much memory as possible to PeptideShaker. For 64 bits machines, typically the amount available on your machine -1GB. This setting can be optimized in <i>Java Option</i> available in the <i>Edit</i> menu.
