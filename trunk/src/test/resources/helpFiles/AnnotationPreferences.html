        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> automatically annotates the a spectrum with the 
            most likely ions given the spectrum and the peptide sequence identified. 
            This includes the automatic selection of neutral losses. 
            <br><br>
            However, the user can override the default annotation by selecting 
            different ion types in this dialog or in the menu below the spectrum. To change the neutral 
            losses one first has to uncheck the <i>Adapt</i> option on the <i>Loss</i> menu. 
            <br><br>
            To make sure that the same ion types are used for all spectra, the user 
            can also turn of the automatic annotation completly by unchecking the 
            <i>Automatic Annotation</i> option.

        <h3>Annotation Accuracy</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In addition to deciding which ion types to use when annotating the spectrum, the 
            user can also change the required accuracy of the annotations. This is done using 
            the <i>Annotation Accuracy Slider</i> to the right of the spectrum or by changing 
            the <i>Fragment Ion Accuracy</i> value in this dialog. Chaning this value will 
            decrease or increase the accuracy required to say that a given peak 
            should be annotated. The maximum value is set to the fragment ion accuracy set 
            in the Search Parameters tab (found on the Edit menu).
            <br><br>
            The <i>Annotation Level Slider</i> is also found to the right of the spectrum 
            (or the value can be selected in the <i>Annotation Level</i> value in this dialog) 
            and lets the user decide how many of the peaks <b>PeptideShaker</b> should try to annotate. 
            The level is set relative to the most intense peak, e.g., 80% means that the tool only 
            considers peaks that have an intensity that is at least 80% of the most intense peak. As 
            the value is reduced more and more of the low intensity peaks will be 
            annotated.
