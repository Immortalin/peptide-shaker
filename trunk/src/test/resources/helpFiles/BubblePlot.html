        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The bubble plot, also referred to as the <i>Planetary System View</i>, represents 
            a novel way of looking at one or multiple spectra at the same time. This view of 
            a spectrum still has the m/z value on the x-axis, but on the y-axis it has 
            the mass error (the distance between the theoretical and the experimental mass of the 
            fragment ions), and finally the size of each bubble represents the (normalized) 
            intensity of each fragment ion.
            <br><br>
            This way of looking at spectra takes a bit of getting used to, but once 
            one is comfortable with the setup, it becomes very easy to pick up details that 
            would have been very difficult to see by a manual inspection of individual spectra.

        <a name="#Annotation"></a>
        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Like for the standard spectrum view, the default fragment ions shown 
            are singly charged b- and y-ions. To annotate other ions simply select 
            the toggle representing the wanted ion type.
            <br><br>
            In this view of the spectrum only the selected and annotated peaks 
            are shown.

        <h3>Bar Highlighting</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The bars highlighting and annotating the fragment ion types can be 
            turned on or off by clicking the toggle names <i>Bars</i>.

        <h3>Multiple Spectra</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The bubble plot has the potential of displaying multiple spectra at 
            once, and is automatically used if more than one row is selected in 
            the Peptide-Spectrum Matches table.
            <br><br>
            One more than one spetrum is selected the individual spectra are 
            annotated with the row index, and the fragment ions are color coded 
            accordingly.

        <h3>Interaction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Zooming is supported by the standard left click and drag approach, and 
            additional plotting features can be accessed via the right click popup 
            menu.
