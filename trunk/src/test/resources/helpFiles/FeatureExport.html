            This dialog makes it straightforward to export data from <b>PeptideShaker</b> to tab separeted text files. 
            One can export all results by clicking the <i>Export as Text Files</i> option at the top, or one can export 
            a selected subset of the data via the <i>Features</i> section. This allows you to export just the data 
            you want. You can either export only the currently displayed data, only the validated data or all data 
            for the data type selected.
