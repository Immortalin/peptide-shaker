        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>e-value filtering:</b> In order to reduce the memory consumption it is possible to remove identifications with a high e-values. 
                It is adviced to keep these values as high as possible in order to ensure that PSMs reach a PEP of 1. This can be verified in the Validation tab.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Peptide Length:</b> lower and upper limits can be set for the peptide length.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Precursor Accuracy:</b> The higher precursor mass error allowed can be set here in order to filter out outliers.
