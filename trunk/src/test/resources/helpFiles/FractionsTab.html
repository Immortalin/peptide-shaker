        <h3>Introduction and Disclaimer</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The <i>Fractions</i> tab shows you can overview of which fractions the proteins were detected in.
            <br><br>
            The values are estimations based on the confidence of a peptide/protein if found in a fraction alone in the context of the whole analysis.
            <br><br>
            <i>These are <u><b>not</b></u> equal the confidence in the peptide/protein identifications when processing the fractions independently!</i>
            <br><br>
            Independant fractions (like different donors, measurements) or replicates should be <u><b>processed separately</b></u>.

        <h3>Plots</h3>
        There are five plot options:
        <ul>
            <li>Peptides: the estimated number of peptides identified in each fraction.</li>
            <li>Spectra: the estimated number of spectra identified in each fraction.</li>
            <li>Intensities: the estimated average precursor intensity for each fraction.</li>
            <li>Coverage: the estimated protein coverage for each fraction.</li>
            <li>Molecular Weight: the estimated molecular weight for each fraction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p align="justify">
            Selecting more than one protein in the table will display the values for all the selected proteins.
            <br><br>
            Note the use of the term 'estimated' above. This is not accidental. While the values can provide an idea of 
            how the data ditributes across the fractions, further analysis will be required to be able to claim that 
            this is indeed the case. However, an analysis that provides sound statistical ground for such claims is in development 
            and will hopefully be available in the near future.
