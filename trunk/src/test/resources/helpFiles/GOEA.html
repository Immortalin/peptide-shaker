        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) analyzes the frequencies of <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">gene ontology</a> 
            terms in your dataset and compares these to the frequencies of the same GO terms in 
            the species specific version of <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a>. In order
            to not get too many terms the GOSlim <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/">UniProtKB-GOA</a> is used.
            <br><br>
            GOEA shows if certain GO terms are significantly up or down regulated in your dataset. 
            To calcualte the significance <b>PeptideShaker</b> employs a 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_test">Hypergeometric test</a>. 
            This divides the GO terms into three groups: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Significantly up regulated (colored green).</li>
            <li>Significantly down regulated (colored red).</li>
            <li>Not significantly regulated (colored grey).</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
            <b><i>Note that the GO Enrichment Analysis only supports <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt</a> accession numbers!</i></b>

        <a name="#Species"></a>
        <h3>Species</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            A long list of species is included. Select the wanted species in the drop down menu 
            in the upper right corner.
            <br><br>
            If you experience any problems with any of the species, please 
            contact us by sending an e-mail to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">PeptideShaker Google Group</a> or 
            by reporting an issue at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/issues/list">PeptideShaker homepage</a>.
            <br><br>
            As a default only human GO term to protein mappings are included. The other species can be downloaded if needed.
            Simply select the species in the drop down menu and click the <i>Download</i> button to start downloading 
            the GO term to protein mappings for that species. For species where the mappings already have been downloaded 
            these can be updated to the current release of Ensembl by clicking the <i>Update</i> button.

        <a name="#Ensembl_Version"></a>
        <h3>Ensembl Version</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> always uses the latest version of <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a> 
            when downloading the GO term to protein mappings. The version used for a given species is shown 
            behind the species name in the species drop down menu. Ensembl is updated with the latest data on a 
            monthly basis and each version is given a number, e.g., Ensembl 64.

        <a name="#GO_Plots"></a>
        <h3>GO Plots</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Two GO plots are available: a <i>significance plot</i> and a <i>distribution plot</i>. The significance plot highlights 
            the significantly up and down regulated GO terms, while the distribution plot shows the frequencies in 
            percent for your dataset compared to the whole of <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a>.
            <br><br>
            The plots are closely connected to the table with the GO terms. Selecting a a row in the table will 
            highlight the same term in the plots and visa versa. GO terms can be excluded from the plot by 
            deselecting them in the final column in the table. Right-clicking in the table will bring up 
            a menu with shortcuts for selecting/deselecting all, and for selecting only the significant GO terms. 
            <br><br>
            The order of the terms in the plot is also the same as for the table. Click the table column headers 
            to re-order the table and plots.
