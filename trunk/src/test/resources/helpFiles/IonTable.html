        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> supports two types of ion tables. The standard 
            one with the theoretical fragment ion m/z-values, and a novel intensity 
            based approach. The default is the intensity based. To display the 
            standard ion table go to the <b>Settings</b> menu.

        <a name="#IntensityIonTable"></a>
        <h3>Intensity Ion Table</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The novel intensity based ion table still shows you the fragment ion 
            covered by the spectrum, but instead of just showing the theoretical 
            fragment ion masses for those ions, it shows the experimental intensity 
            of the ions.
            <br><br>
            This new approach makes it very simple to not only see which fragment 
            ions are found, but also at which intensity (compared to the other 
            detected ions).

        <a name="#Annotation"></a>
        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> automatically annotates the a spectrum with the 
            most likely ions given the spectrum and the peptide sequence identified. 
            This includes the automatic selection of neutral losses. 
            <br><br>
            However, the user can override the default annotation by selecting 
            different ion types in the menu below the table. To change the neutral 
            losses one first has to uncheck the <i>Adapt</i> option on the <i>Loss</i> menu. 
            <br><br>
            To make sure that the same ion types are used for all spectra, the user 
            can also turn of the automatic annotation completly in the <i>Settings</i> 
            menu.
        </p>

        <a name="#AnnotationAccuracy"></a>
        <h3>Annotation Accuracy</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In addition to deciding which ion types to use when annotating the spectrum, the 
            user can also change the desired accuracy for the annotations. This is done by scrolling  
            the mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key. Scrolling up or down (when over the Spectrum panel) will increase or 
            decrease the accuracy required to say that a given peak should be annotated. The maximum value 
            is set to the fragment ion accuracy set in the Search Parameters dialog (found on the <i>Edit</i> menu).
            <br><br>
            Scrolling without holding down any keys lets the user decide how many of the peaks 
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> should try to annotate. The level is set relative 
            to the most intense peak, e.g., 80% means that the tool only considers peaks 
            that have an intensity that is at least 80% of the most intense peak. As 
            the value is reduced more and more of the low intensity peaks will be 
            annotated.
        </p>

        <h3>Multiple Spectra</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The novel intensity based ion table also makes it straightforward 
            to compare the fragment ion coverage of multiple spectra. By simply 
            selecting multiple rows in the Spectrum-Peptide Matches table the 
            average intensity and standard deviation is shown for each fragment 
            ion. In this way the stability of a given fragment ion can easily 
            be detected.
