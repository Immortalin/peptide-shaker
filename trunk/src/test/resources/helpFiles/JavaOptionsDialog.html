        <h3>Memory Limit</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            To increase the upper memory limit increase the Memory Limit value.  
            The upper limit is the RAM memory available in your computers.
            <br><br>
            For example, if you computer has 2GB of RAM memory, you can change 
            the value to a maximum value of 2048 (and usually the actual limit 
            is a bit lower than the max).
            <br><br>
            If the selected value is not supported by your system (32 bits only),      
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> will try to reduce it automatically.                          
            <br><br>
            Note that <b>PeptideShaker</b> needs to restart in order to take 
            the new settings into account.
