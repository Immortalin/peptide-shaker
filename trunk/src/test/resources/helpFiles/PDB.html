        <H2>Peptides to PDB Structure Mapping</H2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> tries to map the detected peptides for a given protein onto the <a href="http://www.pdb.org">PDB structure</a> of 
            the protein. If multiple PDB structures exist for a protein, it is up to the user to select the correct structure. If there are 
            more than one chain in the structure, the user also decides which of the chains to use.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Incomplete Mapping</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Note that the amino acid sequence covered by the PDB structure is almost always shorter than the complete protein 
            sequence. The overlap and the sequence coverage obtained is shown for each chain in the PDB Chains table.
            Due to the often limited coverage provided by the PDB structure, not all peptides can be mapped to the structure. The 
            peptides that can be mapped are annotated in the Peptides table in the lower left and shown in orange on the 
            3D structure model. The currently selected peptide is shown in blue.

        <h3>Interaction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Additional interaction with the structure is achieved by right clicking in the structure panel. For further 
            details on how to modify the structure see <a href="http://www.jmol.org">Jmol</a>. Jmol is an open-source 
            Java viewer for chemical structures, here used to display protein structures.
