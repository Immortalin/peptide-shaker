        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The <i>Modifications tab</i> is dedicated to peptide-level post translational modifications (PTM) analysis. 
            The PTM of interest is selected in the top left corner and the modified peptides present in the dataset will be displayed.
            <br>
            The PTM location displayed here is also displayed in the <i>Overview tab</i> and the <i>3D Structure tab</i>. For example, 
            it is possible to verify here the correctness of the phosphorylation status of a peptide and to visualize it 
            on the sequence in the tables in the <i>Overview tab</i> or on the 3D structure in the <i>3D Structure tab</i>. Finally, you can confront 
            your results with data in UniProt using the <i>Annotation tab</i>.

        <a name="#Selection"></a>
        <h3>Modification Selection</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The modification of choice can be selected. Note that for the sake of simplicity only variable modifications are 
            displayed in <b>PeptideShaker</b>. Modifications are color coded and the colors can be edited in this table or in 
            the <i>Search Preferences</i> accessible from the <i>Edit</i> menu.
        </p>

        <a name="#Peptides"></a>
        <h3>Modified Peptides</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            All peptides found in the dataset with the selected variable modification are listed in the <i>Modified Peptides</i> table. 
            The peptide inference status is displayed like in the <i>Overview</i> tab. Then, the sequence is displayed with the 
            selected PTM location confidence color coded. Note that the peptide modification status is deduced from the PSMs' modification status.
            <br>
            The confidence in the PTM site assignment is color coded based on the PTM location scores:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> 
                <b>delta score:</b> the delta score indicates the confidence in the site assignment by the search engine.
            </li>
            <li> 
                <b>A-score:</b> the A-score tries to find the most likely modification site and then estimates a score relative to the 
                second likely modification site. The A-score is computed only for singly modified peptides and strongly relies on 
                the annotation settings used for spectrum annotation. The spectrum annotation settings can be accessed from the 
                <i>Edit</i> menu. For more information about the A-score see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16964243">Beausoleil et al</a>.
            </li> 
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
            When both scores confidently agree on the PTM site, the PTM is labeled as "Very Confident"; if the A-score is confident 
            but disagrees with the search engine's best assumption, the PTM is labeled as "Confident"; if the A-score is not confident 
            and the delta score is, the location is labeled as "Doubtful"; finally if no score is confident, the modification is labeled 
            as "Random".
            <br><br>
            The scores are annotated on the sequence on the right of the table, the delta score on the top of the selected amino acid 
            and the A-score below.
            <br><br>
            The confidence and validation status of the selected peptide is diplayed as in the <i>Overview</i> tab.

        <h3>Related Peptides</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Whenever a peptide sequence contains or is contained by the selected peptide sequence, this peptide is displayed in the 
            <i>Related Peptides</i> table. For instance, non-modified peptides or miscleaved peptides will be displayed and may help to 
            validate the identification and modification status of the selected peptide.
            <br><br>
            The structure of the <i>Related Peptides</i> table is similar to the <i>Modified Peptides</i> table.

        <a name="#PSMs"></a>
        <h3>Peptide to Spectrum Matches (PSMs)</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The Peptide to Spectrum Matches (PSMs) linking to the selected peptide are displayed in the PSM table. The PTM location 
            score of these PSMs will make the peptide score. If you select a row in the PSM table, the corresponding spectrum will 
            be displayed.

        <h3>Related Peptide to Spectrum Matches</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The Peptide to Spectrum Matches (PSMs) linking to the selected related peptide are displayed in the related PSM table. 
            The spectrum of the PSM is displayed when clicking on the row of interest.

        <a name="#Spectrum"></a>
        <h3>Spectrum and Fragment Ions</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The spectrum of the selected PSM will be displayed with the peaks annotated according to the ion annotation settings. 
            Note that the peak annotation has a dramatic effect on the A-score. It is important to carefully tune the annotation 
            settings when inspecting a doubtful peptide.
            <br><br>
            For more information on how to interact with the spectrum see the help option in the menu below the spectrum.
