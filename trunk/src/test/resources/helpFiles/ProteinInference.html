        <H2>Protein Inference</H2>

        <p align="justify">
            Inferring proteins from peptides is not as simple as it may seem. Some peptides can map to multiple proteins, 
            for example Protein A and Protein B. If no unique peptide ensures the presence of A or B, <b>PeptideShaker</b> 
            cannot say whether Protein A or Protein B (or both) is present.
            <br><br>
            The <i>PI</i> column in the <i>Overview</i> tab stands for <i>Protein Inference</i>. Proteins are here flagged 
            depending on the type of protein inference: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Green:</b> No Conflict, i.e., a Single Protein unambiguously identified</li>
            <li><b>Yellow:</b> Related Proteins identified</li>
            <li><b>Orange:</b> Related and Unrelated Proteins identified</li>
            <li><b>Red:</b> Unrelated Proteins identified</li>
        </ul>
        
         <p align="justify">
            For each type <b>PeptideShaker</b> provides a set of options so that one can manually select the 
            protein consider as the correct one. 
            <br><br>
            In many cases the protein groups are closely related proteins like isoforms
            and depending on your experiment distinguishing between these may or may not be important.  
            <br><br>
            To support your decision you have the list of <i>Unique Hits</i> (if any) of each possible protein, and the 
            list of <i>Related Hits</i> (if any) to this group.
            <br><br>
            For proteins from UniProt you also have the protein evidence to guide the selection. For more information 
            about protein evidence see: <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_existence">http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_existence</a>.
            <br><br>
            To change the protein inference group for the currently selected protein, select the wanted protein in 
            the <i>Candidate Proteins</i> table and click OK. The selection will be automatically updated in the rest of 
            <b>PeptideShaker</b>.
