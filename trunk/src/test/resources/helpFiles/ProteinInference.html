        <H2>Protein Inference</H2>

        <p align="justify">
            Inferring proteins from peptides is not as simple as it may seem. Some peptides can map to multiple proteins, 
            let’s say protein A and protein B. If no unique peptide ensures the presence of A or B, <b>PeptideShaker</b> 
            cannot say whether protein A or protein B is present.
            <br><br>
            The PI column in the Overview tab stands for Protein Inference. Proteins are here flagged depending on the 
            type of protein inference: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Green:</b> No Conflict, i.e., a Single Protein unambiguously identified</li>
            <li><b>Yellow:</b> Isoforms identified</li>
            <li><b>Blue:</b> Unrelated Isoforms identified</li>
            <li><b>Red:</b> Unrelated Proteins identified</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
            For each type <b>PeptideShaker</b> will provide you with a set of options so that you can manually select the 
            protein you consider as the correct one. 
            <br><br>
            In many cases the protein groups are isoforms of the same protein 
            and depending on your experiment this small difference may or may not be important.  
            <br><br>
            To support your decision you have the list of Unique Hits (of any) of each possible protein, and the 
            list of Related Hits (if any) to this group.
            <br><br>
            To change the currently selected protein for the protein inference group, select the wanted protein in 
            the Candidate Proteins table and click OK. The selection will be automatically updated in the rest of 
            <b>PeptideShaker</b>.
