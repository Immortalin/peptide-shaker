        <H2>Protein Inference</H2>

        <p align="justify">
            Inferring proteins from peptides is not as simple as it may seem. Some peptides can map to multiple proteins, 
            let’s say Protein A and Protein B. If no unique peptide ensures the presence of A or B, <b>PeptideShaker</b> 
            cannot say whether Protein A or Protein B is present.
            <br><br>
            The <i>PI</i> column in the <i>Overview</i> tab stands for <i>Protein Inference</i>. Proteins are here flagged 
            depending on the type of protein inference: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Green:</b> No Conflict, i.e., a Single Protein unambiguously identified</li>
            <li><b>Yellow:</b> Isoforms identified</li>
            <li><b>Orange:</b> Unrelated Isoforms identified</li>
            <li><b>Red:</b> Unrelated Proteins identified</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
            For each type <b>PeptideShaker</b> provides you with a set of options so that you can manually select the 
            protein you consider as the correct one. 
            <br><br>
            In many cases the protein groups are isoforms of the same protein 
            and depending on your experiment this small difference may or may not be important.  
            <br><br>
            To support your decision you have the list of <i>Unique Hits</i> (of any) of each possible protein, and the 
            list of <i>Related Hits</i> (if any) to this group.
            <br><br>
            To change the currently selected protein for the protein inference group, select the wanted protein in 
            the <i>Candidate Proteins</i> table and click OK. The selection will be automatically updated in the rest of 
            <b>PeptideShaker</b>.
