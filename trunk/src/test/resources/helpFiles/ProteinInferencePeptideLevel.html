        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> dramatically simplifies the protein inference problem, i.e., the presence of shared peptides between protein sequences. 
            It is here however possible to inspect the protein inference status of a specific peptide.
            <br><br>
            Peptides are color coded depending on whether they can be mapped to a unique protein, a group of isoforms, a group of isoforms and unrelated 
            proteins or totally unrelated proteins. Note that this classification of proteins is roughly made by <b>PeptideShaker</b> using the protein description.
            The upper left button allows you to change the protein inference status of the selected peptide.

        <h3>Retained and Other Proteins</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The retained proteins is the list of proteins where this peptide can be mapped to and which were actually retained by <b>PeptideShaker</b>. To inspect 
            these proteins, you can type the protein accession on the top right search field of <b>PeptideShaker</b> when on the <i>Overview</i> tab.
            <br><br>
            It can however be that a peptide can be mapped to a protein which was not retained by PeptideShaker. These secondary accessions are displayed 
            in the 'Other Proteins' table.
