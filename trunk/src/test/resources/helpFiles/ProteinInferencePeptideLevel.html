        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> attempts to simplify the protein inference problem, i.e., the presence of shared peptides between protein sequences. 
            It is here however possible to inspect the protein inference status of a specific peptide.
            <br><br>
            Peptides are color coded depending on whether they can be mapped to (i) a unique protein, (ii) a group of related proteins, (iii) a group of related and unrelated 
            proteins, or (iv) a group of unrelated proteins. Note that this classification of proteins is not perfect, and a manual validation of interesting protein groups is recommended.
            The drop down menu at the top allows you to change the protein inference status of the selected peptide.
            <br><br>
            For proteins from UniProt you also have the protein evidence to guide the selection. For more information 
            about protein evidence see: <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_existence">http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_existence</a>.

        <h3>Retained and Other Proteins</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The retained proteins is the list of proteins where this peptide can be mapped to and which were actually retained by <b>PeptideShaker</b>. To inspect 
            these type the protein accession in the top right search field of <b>PeptideShaker</b> when in the <i>Overview</i> tab.
            <br><br>
            It can however also be that a peptide is mapped to a protein which was not retained by PeptideShaker. These secondary accessions are displayed 
            in the 'Other Proteins' table.
