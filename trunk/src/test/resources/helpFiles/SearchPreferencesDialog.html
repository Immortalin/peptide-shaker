        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In order to adapt the process to the search it is necessary to provide some information about it to <b>PeptideShaker</b>. 
            Some parameters are set by default, while some have to be set manually. 
            <br><br>
            <i>If the identification files were generated using 
                <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com"><b>SearchGUI</b></a>, settings will be loaded automatically!</i>
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Search Parameters</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The search parameters are mandatory for the import of identifications as well as for their processing and display. 
            Set here the enzyme used, the number of allowed missed cleavages and the fragment ion mass tolerance.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Modification Profile</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The modification profile is a project-dependant set of expected modifications. <b>PeptideShaker</b> will check this 
            list when a PTM is found in the identification results. Modifications can be grouped into families and will then be 
            processed together. 
            <br><br>
            <i>It is vital that two different families do not contain PTMs of the same mass!</i>
            <br><br>
            The modification profile can be saved and opened from here as well.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>SearchGUI Parameters File</h3>
        <p align="justify">            
            For simplicity, it is also possible to load the standard settings from a SearchGUI file.
