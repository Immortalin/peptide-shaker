        <h3>Show All Peaks</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            As a default only the peaks currently annotated 
            by a fragment ion is shown in the foreground. The other peaks are shown 
            in grey in the background. Only (red) peaks in the foreground can be selected. 
            To move all peaks to the foreground click the <i>Show All Peaks</i> option in 
            the menu below the spectrum.

        <a name="#Annotation"></a>
        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> automatically annotates the a spectrum with the 
            most likely ions given the spectrum and the peptide sequence identified. 
            This includes the automatic selection of neutral losses. 
            <br><br>
            However, the user can override the default annotation by selecting 
            different ion types in the menu below the spectrum. To change the neutral 
            losses one first has to uncheck the <i>Adapt</i> option on the <i>Loss</i> menu. 
            <br><br>
            To make sure that the same ion types are used for all spectra, the user 
            can also turn of the automatic annotation completly in the <i>Settings</i> 
            menu.
        </p>

        <a name="#AnnotationAccuracy"></a>
        <h3>Annotation Accuracy</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In addition to deciding which ion types to use when annotating the spectrum, the 
            user can also change the desired accuracy for the annotations. This is done by scrolling  
            the mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key. Scrolling up or down (when over the Spectrum panel) will increase or 
            decrease the accuracy required to say that a given peak should be annotated. The maximum value 
            is set to the fragment ion accuracy set in the Search Parameters dialog (found on the <i>Edit</i> menu).
            <br><br>
            Scrolling without holding down any keys lets the user decide how many of the peaks 
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> should try to annotate. The level is set relative 
            to the most intense peak, e.g., 80% means that the tool only considers peaks 
            that have an intensity that is at least 80% of the most intense peak. As 
            the value is reduced more and more of the low intensity peaks will be 
            annotated.

        <a name="#Zooming"></a>
        <h3>Zooming</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Zooming is achieved by clicking and holding the left mouse
            button where you want to start the zoom, and then drag in
            the direction you want to zoom, marking the area to be
            zoomed. Right clicking in the plot undos the zoom.

        <a name="#De-novoSequencing"></a>
        <h3>De-novo Sequencing</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In <b>PeptideShaker</b> there are two ways of doing de novo sequencing: manual or automatic.
            <br><br>
            <i>Manual:</i> Click on one peak. The distance
            and amino acids matching this distance (if any) will then
            be shown. To add the sequence, click on the second peak.
            Repeat the process to sequence more peaks. 
            <br><br>
            An added sequence
            is removed by holding down the Ctrl button when clicking on
            the sequence. To "store" a sequence, hold down the Alt button
            and click on the sequence, the sequence turns red. To
            remove such "stored" sequences, hold down Ctrl and Alt and
            click in the sequence.
            <br><br>
            <i>Automatic:</i> Go to the <i>De novo</i> option in the menu below the 
            spectrum and select which ion type you would like to annotate. Note that 
            this annotation only tries to find matches against the sequence identified 
            by the PSM, and as such only gives an overview over the match between the 
            sequence and the spectrum for the selected ion types. For a complete <i>de novo</i> 
            sequencing showing all options for each distance use the manual option.

        <h3>Sequence Fragmentation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The plot in the upper left shows the 
            how the peptide sequence is fragmented using the singly charged b- 
            and y-ions. In this plot the blue peaks represent b-ions and red peaks 
            y-ions. Hovering over a given peak will display the fragment ion 
            type and number, e.g., y5.

        <a name="#IntensityHistogram"></a>
        <h3>Intensity Histogram</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The plot in the middle above the spectrum 
            represents the intensity ditribution of the annotated peaks (in green) and 
            the non-annotated peaks (in grey), with intensity bins on the x-axis and 
            frequency on the y-axis. In a well-annotated spectrum most of the high 
            intensity peaks ought to be annotated, while most of the non-annotated 
            peaks ought to have low intensities.

            Zomming is available by the standard left click and drag approach. Additional 
            options are available via the right click popup menu.

            The plot in the upper right displays the standard mass error plot with 
            m/z on the x-axis and mass error (in Da) on the y-axis.
