        <h3>General</h3>
        For every population:
        <ul>
            <li>Optimize the estimator's accuracy</li>
            <li>Set the threshold for the identifications</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The standard populations inspected by <b>PeptideShaker</b> are PSMs, peptides and proteins. However, if statistical significance is ensured PSMs will be separated according to their charge. 
            Similarly, peptides can be separated based on their modification status.

        <h3>Optimize Estimator Accuracy</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The estimators plot will help you to optimize the estimators. Fluctuations in the PEP illustrate a lack of robustness whereas disagreement of FDR estimators shows a lack of sensitivity. This can 
            be corrected by optimizing the PEP window (directly or using the slide bars). By default, the PEP window is set to a minimal value Nmax: the maximum amount of target hits comprised between two 
            subsequent decoy hits.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes the PEP cannot be accurately estimated, for small populations for instance. The confidence and probabilistic estimators will then not be reliable anymore. It is adviced to trust only 
            score and classical FDR.

        <h3>Setting the Threshold</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The thresholds plots allow you to optimize the thresold. Depending on the experimentalist's aims, a balance can be found between quality and quantity. The thresold can be set manually using a 
            minimal confidence threshold, a maximal allowed FDR or a minimal allowed FNR.
