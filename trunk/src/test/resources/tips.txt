You can contribute to <i>PeptideShaker</i>! <br><br> Use our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a> to explain your special needs and exchange new ideas!
Looking for a specific protein?<br><br>You can search/filter proteins via the <i>Filter</i> menu in the <i>Overview</i> tab.
Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are color coded in peptide sequences.<br><br>You can change the colors via <i>Search Parameters</i> on the <i>Edit</i> menu.<br><br>You can also verify the location of the PTMs in the <i>Modifications</i> tab!
User-defined modifications: <br><br>User-defined modifications can be implemented in the conf/peptideshaker_usermods.xml file similarly as in <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>. <br><br>Before loading your files don't forget to add your modification in the Search Parameters!
Not getting the result you wanted?<br><br>When creating a new project, be sure that the <i>Search Parameters</i> and <i>Import Filters</i> are correct!
How to run user-friendly OMSSA and X!Tandem searches?<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a>!
In order to get the best perfomance, give <i>PeptideShaker</i> as much memory as possible in the JavaOptions.txt file located in the conf folder.<br><br>More information available in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section of our website.
Does all your spectra have different titles? <br><br><i>PeptideShaker</i> is not able to differentiate spectra with identical titles in the same mgf file.
How did you generate your mgf file? <br><br>Processing of the raw data can have dramatic impact on the final result.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://open-ms.sourceforge.net">OpenMS</a> for the spectrum processing.
Need more help? <br><br>Look for the question marks. And we will be happy to answer your questions on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>.
Which database are you using? <br><br>Large databases will increase the amount of false positive identifications. For best results you should use only the species expected in the sample.<br><br>We recommend the use of <a href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</a> databases.
Does <i>PeptideShaker</i> not find your protein? <br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that its parsing is done correctly!
Did you expect more peptides/proteins?<br><br>In the <i>Spectrum IDs</i> tab you can verify the performance of all search engines. You can also adjust validation settings in the <i>Validation</i> tab.<br><br>If you compare the results with other packages, remember that you should use same search, import and validation settings!
Working with Mascot?<br><br>Make sure that the database used for the search is the same as the one provided to PeptideShaker and that the "decoy" option is disabled!
Did you check the QC plots?<br><br>Quality Control plots are available in the QC tab and can help you to verify that everything went right during the identification process.
You need a new QC metric/plot?<br><br> Propose it on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!
