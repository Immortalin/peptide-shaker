 * NEW FEATURE: QC plot tab added.
 * NEW FEATURE: Annotation tab with links to other protein resources.
 * NEW FEATURE: Made it possible to use relative of absolute error in the mass error and bubble plots.
 * NEW FEATURE: Added a new sequence coverage plot with all the found peptides indicated.
 * NEW FEATURE: PTM location confidence scoring.
 * NEW FEATURE: Added a Welcome dialog.
 * NEW FEATURE: Protein inference is now displayed also at the peptide level.
 * NEW FEATURE: PTM color coding.
 * NEW FEATURE: Modification profile plots.
 * NEW FEATURE: The 10 last recently opened projects can now be opened directly from the File menu.
 * NEW FEATURE: Simpe export of identification features, and contextual exports for each panel.
 * NEW FEATURE: FASTA and spectrum files are now indexed and not loaded into memory anymore.
 * NEW FEATURE: Annotation intensity level slider and annotation accuracy sliders added to the spectrum plots.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: A global maximum is now used for the sparklines for all charge and mass error columns.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Updated most of the help texts.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The peptides are now sorted according to their number of spectra.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Modifications are now shown directly on the peptide sequence. Modifications are now also mapped onto the 3D structure.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Y-axis auto zoom in the spectrum plots now disregards unannotated peaks (unless all peaks are shown).
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Changed the default -Mxm option from 1500M to 1024M, to make sure that the tool starts on all machines.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Spectrum annotation selection has been made simpler by the addition of an annotation menu bar.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Added a secondary progress bar in the WaitingDialog showing progress for the current process.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Added terminals to the sequence fragmentation plots.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Use of subscript for the numbers in all peak annotations in all plots.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Improved automatic spectrum annotation.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The mgf paths in the search result files OS independent.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The two residues in front of and after the selected peptide is now shown in the panel title of the spectrum panel.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Improved the way exceptions related to proteins not found in the FASTA file are handled. PeptideShaker now stops the loading of a project if such an exception is thrown.
 * BUG FIX: Removed peptides without PSMs from the display.
 * LIBRARY UPDATE: Updated utilities to 3.2.20.
 * LIBRARY UPDATE: Updated jsparklines to version 0.5.20.
 * LIBRARY UPDATE: Updated xtandem parser to version 1.3.5.

 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The link between the Overview and the Structure tab is now smarter, and updates less frequently.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The maximum initial Java memory size is now set to 1500M (the magic number for 32 bit Java...).
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Improved the wrapper so that it now defaults to using the 64 bit Java version if available.
 * BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in the dialog displayed when detecting an unknown protein, where the title and the message was interchanged.
 * BUG FIX: The files selection dialog (for multiple SearchGUI property files) is now located relative to its parent.
